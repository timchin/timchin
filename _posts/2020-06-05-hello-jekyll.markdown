This is my first post. This is the first website that I'm really building from scratch as a place to show off everything I've done and have been working on. So far, there's not much to show but I am hoping that it will grow over time. This new chapter in my life will be the culmination of all of my knowledge so far. I plan on building multiple YouTube channels and creating some quality consumable content. Here's a brief rundown of the channels that I plan on creating:



## Timtographer

This is going to represent my main interests and is my main passion project. I will be publishing videos related to photo, video, editing, etc. I plan on publishing the footage from Portland (Powell's, Arcade, others TBD...) as well as recordings of me editing photos. I may eventually put videos of me editing my videos together as some sort of meta work flow kind of video. This channel will have to grow over time alongside me as I develop my own interests and workflow and decide what kind of content matters most to me in the close-to-heart world of photography and videography. It would also be great to get a drone eventually and shoot some dope drone footage!



## The Internet (Abridged)

For now the title is tentative as there currently exists a website with this exact name. Though the site appears to be more of a pet project so I doubt there exists any sort of copyright or legal trouble I could get into for using it. 

In any case, the idea for the video creation is to compile videos of the most popular internet clips and provide some voice over that explains the context or relevant and/or interesting background information for the clips involved. Not every clip will have an explanation, but perhaps every 2nd or 3rd clip will.



## Some Kind of Cooking channel

Still not sure what to call this channel, but I would love to make a very calm, relaxing and peaceful cooking channel that's ASMR-ish with excellent photography and nice sound quality. I want to recreate some of my most treasured recipes and share them with excellent photographic quality.
