<p class="text-light">
My name is Tim and I am a software engineer turned photographer and videographer. I've always had creative interests in photo and video and recently decided to take the next step in my life toward making my passion into my full time career. I still have a lot to learn and improve, but I'm constantly looking for ways to better myself and my craft. Thanks for visiting and please do reach out if there's anything you think I might be able to help you with.
